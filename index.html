    <li>NOTE: For many classes, it makes sense to spend Day 4 on AppBuilder challenges, and on strengthening students&apos; understanding of JS and data structures. Feel free to do that if you think your class will enjoy it! You can then implement this day 4 curriculum on day 5.</li>
    <li>Let students know that, today, they&apos;ve reached a point where they know a lot of code, and they&apos;re ready to begin using their new skills for real. Let them know that you&apos;re going to talk briefly about how coding works in practice and then you&apos;re going to get started making apps.</li>
    <li><em>Student Discussion (2 minutes): How do engineers work? (We want to help students understand what its like to work as a coder or designer)</em>
        <ul>
            <li>Do you think that engineers work on new projects most of the time or make improvements to existing projects most of the time? (Answer: existing projects)</li>
            <li>Whats an example of a change you imagine an engineer at Facebook might make? (Adding a button or creating a new kind of page; it would take a long time)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><em>Student Discussion: Why are engineers (and designers) important? (2 minutes)</em>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Answer:&nbsp;</em>They support and maintain tools that people use every days, including tools that do important things</li>
            <li>Follow up Q: What&rsquo;s an important piece of tech that someone in your life uses? How do you think engineers planned and designed it?</li>

    <li><em>Platform introduction, teacher led (8 minutes):</em>
        <ul>
            <li>*NOTE* The video at the end of this article summarizes this walkthrough. It might make sense to check that out and then return to read the instructions here.</li>
            <li>Remind students they&apos;re going to start coding for real. Sharing your screen, have students follow along with you as you explain how to use our platform to find a nonprofit project, see the wireframe (including task list) for the project, and start working on it in AppBuilder<ul>
                    <li>Show students the nonprofits list. Let students know that our company supports lots of nonprofits with good missions. <strong>Make it clear that these are real companies.&nbsp;</strong>Show students how to use the state filter to filter geographically.</li>
                    <li>Demonstrate to students that each project has the App and Wireframe linked. Let students know that the nonprofits sent in the information provided in the platform describing the app they want.</li>
                    <li>Open the wireframe for a nonprofit . Explain to students what a wireframe is. Show them the task list for a nonprofit and explain that the task list shows everyone who&apos;s done work on an app, in addition to showing what remains to be done.</li>
                    <li>Open the app project for a nonprofit, from the nonprofit list. <strong>Show students the Contribute pane.</strong> Show students that they can have the wireframe open while they code, making it easy to ensure that they are on track. Show students that they can click the <em>Test WebApp</em> button in the upper right to see a full page version of the app they&apos;re working on.</li>
                    <li>Demonstrate for students that we are working on real apps, by showing them that the changes you make are reflected on your phone. You can do this with the VACApp. Getting the VACApp takes (literally) two minutes. <a class="ql-link" data-slab-linktype="text" href="https://graceful-purple-elk.slab.com/posts/accessing-the-vac-app-a5gwc9eg" rel="noopener noreferrer">See how to do that here.</a>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Once you have the VACApp, open one of the nonprofit apps on your phone. Show students that the app is on your phone by holding it up to the camera. Make a minor visual change to the app in AppBuilder, and Save. Reload the VACApp and show students that the changes have been reflected on your phone.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Take students to the group skills page. Show students that you&apos;re going to track their progress, and what skills they&apos;ve shown in their work, on this page.&nbsp;</li>

            </li>
